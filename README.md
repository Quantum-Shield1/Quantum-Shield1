#Quantum Shield â€“ Foundation Phase (Step 1)

Welcome to the first phase of the **Quantum Shield** project, a Layer 1 network resistant to quantum computing.

 ---

## The goal of this stage

Preparing the core engine of the blockchain, which includes:

- Building the block structure ('Block Structure')
- Connecting the blocks sequentially to form the chain
- Signing each block using a post-quantum signature (PQC - experimental)
- Generating a hash for each block using SHA256

---

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following tools:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (We recommend installing it via `rustup`)
- Libraries:
- `sha2` (for hashing)
- `chrono` (for timing)
- `serde` and `serde_json` (for serialization/downloading)

Can be installed via:

```bash
cargo add sha2 chrono serde serde_json
